## Description

This is the second semester project at Noroff. We have been tasked to design and code an auction website. I created Gembid as an gem themed auction site. 
All the lisitngs and user information are provided by the Noroff Api.

As a unregistred user you can:

- see all listings
- open a single listing to get more detail
- search through the listings
- sign up for a new account

As a registered you can:

- all off the above
- see bids made on a listing
- login
- place a bid on a listing
- see your credit balance
- visit your profilepage
- create a new lisiting
- change your avatarpic

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
